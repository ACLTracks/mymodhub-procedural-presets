Pack Validation Checklist
Pack Validation Checklist

This checklist is for authors before submission and for automated or manual validation.

If every box is checked, the pack is valid.

1. File Structure

 Pack folder follows the required layout
manifest.json, index.json, entries/*.json

 No extra files at the root level

 Optional folders only contain relevant assets
previews/, assets/

2. Schema Compliance

 manifest.json validates against pack-manifest.schema.json

 index.json validates against pack-index.schema.json

 Every entry validates against racemenu-morph-entry.schema.json

 schema_version fields are present and correct

 No unknown or misspelled fields

3. Identity and Metadata

 pack_id is lowercase, stable, and unique

 Pack name and descriptions are clear and accurate

 Author information is filled out

 License is explicitly defined

 Tags are relevant and not misleading

4. Content Rules

 No head parts are modified
hair, eyes, brows, head meshes untouched

 No skeleton, animation, or body data included

 Only RaceMenu morph sliders are affected

 No runtime randomness or hidden logic

5. Apply Safety

 Default apply mode is clamped_additive

 Morph values are conservative and reasonable

 skip_missing_sliders is enabled

 No assumptions about specific ENBs, textures, or lighting

6. Entry Design Quality

 Each entry represents one clear intent

 Entries do not attempt to do everything at once

 Values stack cleanly with other entries

 Applying the same entry twice does not explode the face

7. Compatibility Testing

 Tested on a clean character

 Tested with different head parts

 Tested with High Poly Head enabled and disabled

 Pack removal does not break saves or characters

8. Assets and Previews

 Preview images match the actual result

 No misleading angles or lighting tricks

 Assets are optional and correctly referenced

 No copyrighted images without permission

9. Integrity and Cleanliness

 No unused files

 No duplicate entry IDs

 No broken paths

 No leftover test values

Final Check

 You would install this pack yourself on a real playthrough

If any box is unchecked, fix it before submission.
