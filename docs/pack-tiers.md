# Pack Tiers

## Core Principle

Not all packs should be treated the same.

Some packs are:
- stable
- safe
- broadly compatible

Others are:
- new
- opinionated
- pushing limits
- still evolving

MyModHub should signal that difference clearly, without banning experimentation.

## Pack Tiers

## 1. Featured Packs

### What this means
Featured packs are trusted, stable, and recommended for general use.

They represent:
- best practices
- ecosystem standards
- remix-safe building blocks

### Requirements
To be Featured, a pack must:
- pass all validation checks
- score consistently high in the review rubric
- be additive and non-destructive
- have clear intent and documentation
- demonstrate compatibility across setups
- avoid extreme values or niche assumptions

### What users can expect
- safe to install mid-playthrough
- predictable results
- minimal risk
- good stacking behavior with other packs

### UI treatment
- Featured badge
- default visibility on browse pages
- included in curated collections
- highlighted in search results
- eligible for homepage promotion

### Social signal
Featured packs are what you install when you want results without drama.

## 2. Experimental Packs

### What this means
Experimental packs are valid, but intentionally pushing boundaries.

They exist to:
- test new ideas
- explore extreme styles
- prototype new systems
- gather feedback

Experimental does not mean broken.  
It means not yet proven at scale.

### Requirements
Experimental packs must:
- still pass schema validation
- still respect user control rules
- clearly disclose what makes them experimental
- include strong author notes

They may:
- use stronger morph values
- assume certain aesthetics
- explore niche use cases
- change rapidly between versions

### What users can expect
- more dramatic results
- possible edge cases
- faster iteration
- occasional breakage when stacking

### UI treatment
- Experimental badge
- hidden behind a toggle by default
- clear warning copy
- not included in curated collections
- not promoted on homepage

### Social signal
Experimental packs are for people who like to explore, test, and push the system.

## Submission Flow

When submitting a pack, authors choose:
- Featured candidate
- Experimental

### If an author selects Featured
- full review rubric applies
- higher bar for acceptance
- may be downgraded to Experimental if it misses criteria

### If an author selects Experimental
- faster review
- lower barrier to entry
- clear experimental labeling applied automatically

This avoids ego fights and sets expectations early.

---

## Promotion Rules

Only Featured packs can be promoted platform-wide.

Experimental packs can be featured in:
- dev logs
- experimental spotlights
- opt-in discovery feeds

This lets innovation breathe without confusing casual users.

---

## Version Progression

Packs can move between tiers.

### Experimental to Featured
- after stability is proven
- after feedback is incorporated
- after metadata and documentation improve

### Featured to Experimental
- if major breaking changes occur
- if scope expands significantly
- if stability regresses

This is normal. It is not punishment.

---

## Community Trust Signals

Each pack page should clearly show:
- tier status
- validation status
- last reviewed date
- version maturity

No hidden rules.  
No surprise breakage.

---

## Why This Works

- new creators feel welcome
- power users get playgrounds
- casual users stay safe
- the ecosystem stays clean
- you do not become the taste police

Featured is about reliability.  
Experimental is about exploration.

Both are necessary.

## Optional Add-On Later

If you want to go further later:
- add a third tier: Deprecated
- add community confidence scores
- add “Built With This Pack” links

But do not start there.
